              p.card-text
                | Hitry is the next decade&apos;s shopping experience. It will allow customers to virtually try on clothes before they buy, providing a better sense of sizing and fit. In the end, this will lead to an enhanced online shopping experience.

              h5.card-title.mb-3 Why Hitry?
              p.card-text
                | As we all know, online shopping is at its peak nowadays. However, during the online shopping experience, we sometimes face issues with returning items due to sizing, fitting, or even looks-related concerns. What you see may not always look good on you in reality. That&apos;s where Hitry comes in: it allows you to virtually try on clothes before making a decision.

              h5.card-title.mb-3 When will Hitry be in execution?
              p.card-text
                | Hitry is a revolutionary idea that will take some time to come into execution. The technology and accessories needed to execute this idea are quite challenging and time-consuming. However, we are working rigorously and knocking on all possible doors to bring it into execution soon. The wait will be worth it &ndash; we&rsquo;re aiming for a big bang!

                | We are currently in the research phase, gathering all the necessary information and connecting with experts who can help us refine our vision and provide the right direction. The good news is that we have already submitted this idea to one of the top incubators.

              | Hit Shiroya is an Associate Engineer working in the IT field for more than 2 years and has developed expertise in the industry. His real-world experience led him to identify a significant issue, and his statistical research highlighted alarming results. To address this issue, he came up with Hitry.
            p.text-left.text-justify.mb-4
              | In his own words: &apos;We never imagined that we would be here, where we can shop for clothes online. Two decades ago, we used to purchase clothes in person, but now technology has advanced so much that we have this convenience. However, it comes with its own limitations, namely the inability to try on clothes while purchasing, which sometimes leads to returns or customers backing off from the purchase. Now, it&rsquo;s high time to address these limitations. With new technology, we can solve this issue. My vision is to create a future world where everyone can try before they buy with Hitry, making AR/VR try-ons a necessity in the near future.&apos;
